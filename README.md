# Replication Package: Enforcement Spillovers in Product Markets: Evidence from E-cigarettes

This repository contains the preliminary replication package for the working paper
**Enforcement Spillovers in Product Markets: Evidence from E-cigarettes**.  

## Contents
- `scripts/cleaning_and_prep/` — Python (`.py`) and Stata (`.do`) scripts for data cleaning and preparation.
- `scripts/analysis` — Python (`.py`) and Stata (`.do`) scripts for summary statistics and econometric analysis. The scripts generate all tables and figures in the paper.
- `output/` — Placeholder only. For regression output, tables, and figures.
- `data/` — Placeholder only (see [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for instructions on how to obtain raw data).  


## Highlights
- End-to-end reproducible workflow: raw → cleaned → analysis → tables/figures.
- Mix of **Python (pandas)** for data wrangling and **Stata** for econometric analysis.
- Code reproduces all tables and figures in the working paper.

*Note: If you are a prospective employer browsing this repo, the exclusion of raw data is deliberate. The focus here is on the **code** — which demonstrates skills in Python, Stata, and reproducible research workflows.*
